				<h1>Web Components</h1>
				<p>
					When I started learning web development I started with the basics:
					HTML, CSS (SCSS) and Javascript. With those three simple things I was
					able to create such fun and diverse projects. Were they poorly
					written? You betcha. But they were written. And they did things! Most
					of the time those things were the ones I told it to. Sometimes they
					weren't.
					<br />
					<br />
					I digress.
					<br />
					<br />
					At the time I was learning Javascript and was having trouble
					requesting data from a local file or API, which was when I came across
					JQuery. And I'll admit it seemed great at first glace; a somewhat
					shorter and easier to comprehend
					<a
						class="content--link"
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages)"
						class="definition"
						>syntax (the way you write the code itself)</a
					>. However I soon found out that really anything JQuery could do, one
					could do with Javascript. And in all honestly I was really only
					importing to do this one task I was struggling with. I eventually got
					the hang of doing these requests in Javascript (Read: googling it
					every single time I need to perform a request) and that was the last I
					had to do with JQuery.
					<br />
					<br />
					This seemed to birth in me a deep want to keep my code clean, bare
					bones, if I could. And then I landed a job, working in React.
				</p>
				<br />
				<h3>React - Oh My</h3>
				<p>
					If you don't know what React is, basically, it's anything but plain
					ol' HTML, CSS and Javascript. It's those on steroids, wrapped in more
					Javascript and magic. Lots of magic.
					<br />
					<br />
					I had learned a little bit of React on my web development journey (of
					around 12 months at the time of this job offer). In saying that, 'a
					little bit' was like if I said I knew a little maths, when I'd just
					barely learned to add 2 + 10. It was a sink or swim situation. And I
					definitely felt like I was sinking. For at least the first six months.
					And I hated it. It was so such an obnoxious, bloated, convoluted way
					of putting words and pictures on a screen. The fact that I really
					didn't understand what I was doing did not help this.
					<br />
					<br />
					Slowly though, the tables turned, just a little bit. I started to
					enjoy it, as I plowed through bunches of pages for the project we were
					working on. Learning more about the logic behind it all, I could start
					to appreciate the purpose of React. These were things I hadn't
					attempted in Javascript; things like keeping state, complex dynamic
					rendering, self contained nuggets of HTML, CSS and Javascript which
					could be thrown into practically any page. I should also say the
					structure of the project had also been reworked quite heavily, and in
					a way which made waaaaay more sense to my inexperienced dev brain.
					This took a lot of friction out of the work I was doing, giving me
					more time and brain-space to dedicate to React itself.
					<br />
					<br />
					When I decided to move on from this job, I had developed an
					appreciation of React and wanted to keep using it. Except deploying
					was a pain in the butt. Then there was the overall size of a React app
					(super big, if you were wondering), and did I really need all of that
					for what I wanted to build? Short answer -- No. So I went in search of
					an alternative, as I really didn't want to be hand coding entire
					websites.
					<br />
					<br />
					Enter... <em>P</em>react
				</p>
				<br />
				<h3>Preact - Not quite React</h3>
				<p>
					I'll cut to the chase. It's fine. It's ok. It's like React, but a
					little more painful to get up and running. It is lighter, though I
					never did a direct comparison to be honest. But for what I was
					building, still a bit of overkill. And the amount of fiddling I have
					had to do to score well on page load speeds, and to be SEO efficient
					was bonkers.
					<br />
					<br />
					I was right at the end of building an e-commerce site, with all of
					this pain of prerendering pages, fancy ways of getting meta tags on
					the right pages, updating the url manually because technically this
					was a single page application (SPA). It was then when I really started
					realising I may have just been better off building it all the ol'
					school way. The tried and true. HTML. CSS. Javascript. The holy
					trinity.
					<br />
					<br />
					This was also around the time I had stumbled onto articles about
					<a
						class="content--link"
						href="./sustainable-web-development.html"
						target="_blank"
						>sustainable web development</a
					>
					and I started understanding how truly well an environmentally
					friendl(y/ier) website could be so beneficial for everyone involved.
					User, client, environment, developer.

				<h3>Web Components</h3>
				<p>
					Ok, we've finally gotten to the title of this page! Web components.
					Phew.
