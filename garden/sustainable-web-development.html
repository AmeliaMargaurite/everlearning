				<h1>Sustainable Web Development</h1>
				<p>
					So technically I haven't even finished setting up this site, but I
					have to go ahead and start writing now. I've been working on expanding
					my self-education around all things web development/internet/life, and
					today stumbled onto this post from A List Apart
					<a
						class="content--link"
						href="https://alistapart.com/article/sustainable-web-design-excerpt/"
						>Sustainable Web Design, An Excerpt</a
					>. I will admit that sustainability regarding the internet isn't
					something I think of often. I have heard in passing of the hidden
					environmental costs involved with browsing the web, however I honestly
					never thought too much about it. I'm going to make sure that changes.
					<br />
					<br />
					Within this excerpt from A List Apart, Tom mentions this tool,
					<a class="content--link" href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/"
						>Website Carbon Calculator</a
					>, his team has built to assess a websites carbon emissions, and the
					form of energy the hosting service uses. The website I am currently
					building has scored well in terms of cleanliness of the site.
					Unfortunately the hosting for the site is using, in their terms, 'bog
					standard energy'. Which in turn has prompted me to research more into
					sustainable hosting.

					I started off in just plain HTML, CSS, and then banging my head
					against Javascript.
