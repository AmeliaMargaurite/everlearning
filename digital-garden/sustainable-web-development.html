			<h1>Sustainable Web Development</h1>
			<p>
				So technically I haven't even finished setting up this site, but I have
				to go ahead and start writing now. I've been working on expanding my
				self-education around all things web development/internet/life, and
				today stumbled onto this post from A List Apart
				<a href="https://alistapart.com/article/sustainable-web-design-excerpt/"
					>Sustainable Web Design, An Excerpt</a
				>. I will admit that sustainability regarding the internet isn't
				something I think of often. I have heard in passing of the hidden
				environmental costs involved with browsing the web, however I honestly
				never thought too much about it. I'm going to make sure that changes.
				<br />
				<br />
				Within this excerpt from A List Apart, Tom mentions this tool,
				<a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/">Website Carbon Calculator</a>,
				his team has built to assess a websites carbon emissions, and the form
				of energy the hosting service uses. The website I am currently building
				has scored well in terms of cleanliness of the site. Unfortunately the
				hosting for the site is using, in their terms, 'bog standard energy'.
				Which in turn has prompted me to research more into sustainable hosting.
